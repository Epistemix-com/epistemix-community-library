    "# Classic Schelling Model on a Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "Thomas Schelling's classic agent-based model of residential segregation demonstrates that, under certain circumstances, individual preferences for having a relatively modest fraction of your neighbors share a common characteristic (in his model, race; in our implementation, red or blue color) are sufficient to generate communities that exhibit a surprising degree of segregation along the lines of that characterstic.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of those circumstances in that original model is that the agents live on a grid of households, where each household has 8 neighboring households, some fraction of which are unoccupied. Then, agents evaluate whether they are happy with their current household location by determining whether the fraction of their neighbors that share the same value for the key characteristic exceeds a given threshold. If an agent determines that they are unhappy with their current household location, then they will move to a random unoccupied house.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can think of a grid as being just one special case of a network topology and ask: How (if at all) do the dynamics of the Schelling model change if we change the network topology?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more than just an academic question --- there are many spaces, e.g., online spaces, where agents might choose to seek out \"neighbors\" who are \"similar\" to them in some way, but where their choice of neighbors is less limited by the geography of the physical environment. And, in these settings, as in the (stylized) physical setting of the original models, the dynamics of Schelling-type models can tell us something about how communities might emerge in those environments. For example, if we consider the network as representing a conduit for information, in addition to representing a \"neighbor\" relationship, e.g., on a social media platform, then the tendency of agents to \"segregate\" (or not \"segregate\") in that environment may help uncover insights about phenomena like political polarization or extremification (think \"echo chambers\" or \"filter bubbles\").\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of the structured environment of the grid, however, is that it is easy to see whether segregation emerges in a given simulation. It is very visually apparent! To explore the dynamics of the Schelling model on more general networks, which in general do not have a convenient standard visual representation like a grid, we will need to use new tools. For each simulation:\n",
    "1. We compute the average fraction of red neighbors across all agents of each color. For blue agents, this is the fraction of their neighbors who are different from them. For red agents, it is the fraction of their neighbors who are similar to them.\n",
    "2. We create an animation of the network on each day of the simulation, where an agent's position in the horizontal direction indicates their fraction of red neighbors. Thus, blue (resp. red) agents will move to the left (right) as their fraction of similar neighbors increases. An agent's position in the vertical direction is arbitrary. (I recommend clicking through these animations frame-by-frame using the single-arrow-followed-by-vertical-bar buttons.)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's look at these outputs for the standard Schelling model on a grid:"

    "Another key feature of the grid that we highlighted previously is the structure that it imposes on neighborhoods. That is, when an agent moves to a new household location in the grid, they necessarily share neighbors with their new neighbors (e.g., their new neighbor to the north is the western neighbor of their neighbor to the northwest). We can incorporate a similar notion in the random network by having unhappy agents preferentially attach to clusters of new neighbors when they re-connect their edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be precise, when an agent is unhappy in this model, they delete all of their edges, then find a new \"central\" agent with an open neighbor spot. Then, to re-connect the rest of their deleted edges, they first look to connect with neighbors of the \"central\" agent. If they cannot re-connect all of their edges with neighbors of the \"central\" agent, then they look among neighbors and neighbors' neighbors (the \"two-hop\" neighborhood) of the central agent, and so on. Once they find a radius *r* such that the *r*-hop neighborhood of the central agent contains enough agents with empty neighbor spots, the agent re-connects their edges to agents in that neighborhood. Those agents are selected with probability proportional to their number of hops from the \"central\" agent."
